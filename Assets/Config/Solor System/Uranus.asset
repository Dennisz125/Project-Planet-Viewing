  primaryInfo: "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured
    ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical
    phase of matter, which astronomy calls \"ice\" or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere
    has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature
    (49 K (\u2212224 \xB0C; \u2212371 \xB0F)) of all the Solar System's planets.
    It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23\xB0 with a retrograde rotation period of
    17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around
    the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42
    years of continuous darkness."
