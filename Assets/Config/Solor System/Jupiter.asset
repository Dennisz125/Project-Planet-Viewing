  primaryInfo: Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
    System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other
    planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the
    mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth, and a tenth that
    of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with
    an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third-brightest natural object in
    the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since
    prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the chief deity of
    ancient Roman religion.
