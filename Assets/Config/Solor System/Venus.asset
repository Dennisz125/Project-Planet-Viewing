  primaryInfo: "Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet
    and is the closest in mass and size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has
    by far the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed mostly of
    carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the surface
    it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 \xB0C; 867 \xB0F) and a pressure 92 times
    that of Earth's at sea level. These extreme conditions compress carbon dioxide
    into a supercritical state at Venus's surface."
