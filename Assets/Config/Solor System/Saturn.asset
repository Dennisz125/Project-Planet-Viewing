  primaryInfo: Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in
    the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of
    about nine times that of Earth.[27][28] It has an eighth the average density
    of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[29][30][31] Even though Saturn is
    almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third its mass. Saturn orbits
    the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of
    29.45 years.
