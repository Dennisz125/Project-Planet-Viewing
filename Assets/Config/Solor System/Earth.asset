  primaryInfo: Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
    known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only
    one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's
    water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The
    remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form
    of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land
    is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice
    at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers,
    and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic
    plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.
    Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting
    most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.
