  primaryInfo: 'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red
    because it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red
    Planet".[22][23] Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth''s sky, and its
    high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing.
    It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar
    System''s planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital
    motion, a Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.6 hours, and a Martian solar
    year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days). Mars has two natural satellites
    that are small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos.'
