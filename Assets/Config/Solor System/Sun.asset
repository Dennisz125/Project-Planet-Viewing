  primaryInfo: The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive,
    nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion
    reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible
    light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the
    most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object
    of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical
    research since antiquity.
